# Multi-Variate-Regression-Case-Study-
## Multivariable regression pipeline to predict time taken for a package delivery business.
## Problem Statement

Regional Delivery Service, Inc. (RDS) is a small business focused on same-day delivery of letters, packages, and small items. To save time and reduce fuel costs, the company uses Google Maps to combine several deliveries into one trip. However, thereâ€™s a need to develop a reliable way to estimate delivery times based on 13 important factors that affect how long a delivery takes. Doing so will help RDS operate more efficiently and provide better service to customers.

## OBJECTIVES
- Develop a multivariable regression pipeline to predict time taken for a package delivery business.
- Develop three different models (on the basis of given set of hypotheses) and compare their performance.

## ABOUT DATA SET
- Data set has 100 rows and 14 columns
- There are 13 feature variables and 1 target variable "Time Taken"
