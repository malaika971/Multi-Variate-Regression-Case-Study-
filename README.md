# Multi-Variate-Regression-Case-Study-
## Multivariable regression pipeline to predict time taken for a package delivery business.
## Problem Statement
Let's assume that you are a small business owner for Regional Delivery Service, Inc. (RDS) who offers same-day delivery for letters, packages, and other small cargo. You are able to use Google Maps to group individual deliveries into one trip to reduce time and fuel costs. Therefore some trips will have more than one delivery. As the owner, you would like to be able to estimate how long a delivery will take based on 13 factors.

## OBJECTIVES
- Develop a multivariable regression pipeline to predict time taken for a package delivery business.
- Develop three different models (on the basis of given set of hypotheses) and compare their performance.

## ABOUT DATA SET
- Data set has 100 rows and 14 columns
- There are 13 feature variables and 1 target variable "Time Taken"
